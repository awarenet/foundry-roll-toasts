# Roll Toasts
Are you sick of switching to the chat log to see a roll result? I know I was!


Roll Toasts is a module for DnD 5E and P2FE Systems that allows the user to see rolls in a toast notification feed.
Each toast notification is a simple view of the character, roll type and result.

Setup is per user and allows you to filter what you want and don't want to see.
